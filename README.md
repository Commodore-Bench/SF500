THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Heavily inspired by Matthias Heinrichs' CDTV-RAM-IDE board. Many thanks to Matze for sharing his work and letting me open source this project.

https://gitlab.com/MHeinrichs/CDTV-RAM-IDE/

Please note, if you are going to build boards and sell for profit, you will need a consent from Matthias and also from Oliver Kastl if you are going to bundle this software http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/oktapus with the hardware (ROM-chip).

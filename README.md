THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Heavily inspired by Matthias Heinrichs' CDTV-RAM-IDE board. Many thanks to Matze for sharing his work and letting me open source this project.

Please note, if you are going to build boards and sell for profit, you will need a consent from Matthias and also from Oliver Kastl if you are going to bundle this software http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/oktapus with the hardware (ROM-chip).
